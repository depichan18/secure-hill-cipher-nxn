# üîê Hill Cipher with Matrix Inversion $(n√ón)$ using Printable ASCII

This project implements the **Hill Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm** using **customizable $n \times n$ matrices** (where $n$ ranges from 2 to 7) and supports **printable ASCII characters** under **modulo 97** arithmetic.

## üöÄ Features

- Encrypt and decrypt text using the Hill Cipher.
- Supports matrix sizes from **2√ó2 up to 7√ó7**.
- Works with **printable ASCII characters (mod 97)** for compatibility and readability.
- Input text manually or upload `.txt` files for batch processing.
- Automatically pads plaintext to match block size.
- Ensures key matrix is invertible (mod 97) before use.

## üìö Concept Overview

- Based on **linear algebra**, particularly matrix multiplication and modular inversion.
- The project highlights the **crucial role of matrix inversion** in the decryption process.
- Designed to show how mathematical concepts like **modular arithmetic** and **determinants** are applied in cryptography.

## üß† Educational Value

This project is ideal for students learning about:
- Linear algebra applications in computer science,
- Modular arithmetic,
- Classical ciphers and cryptographic foundations.
